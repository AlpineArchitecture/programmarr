"""test_live_update_guard.py — the name-match guard on in-place channel updates.

Regression test for the by-number scramble bug: when channels.json drifts out of
sync with Tunarr (e.g. two Programmarr instances writing one Tunarr, or an orphan
channel shifting numbers), update_channel_in_place must NOT blindly overwrite
whatever channel happens to sit at that number. It looks the channel up by number,
and if the Tunarr channel's name doesn't match the name we intended to patch, it
refuses (raises ChannelEngineError) instead of scrambling the lineup.

See docs/live-channels-design.md (In-Place Update Requirement) and CLAUDE.md
(Live Channels rule 1).
